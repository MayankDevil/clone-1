							     	<p> In 2004, Leone was part of No More Bush Girls, in which she and several other popular adult actresses shaved off their pubic hair in protest of the George W. Bush presidency.[152] In May 2008, she shot a promotional video for Declare Yourself, a nonprofit, nonpartisan voter registration campaign targeting 18- to 29-year-olds.[153] She indicated that Barack Obama would be her choice in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, primarily because she felt he was more business friendly to the adult industry than his opponent John McCain.[154] She also released a public service announcement on behalf of the ASACP, urging adult website webmasters to protect their sites from children by having an RTA label on it.[citation needed]</p>

							<p> In 2013, Leone posed for a PETA ad campaign, encouraging dog and cat owners to have their pets spayed and neutered. In an interview for PETA India, Leone said, "I believe that every single dog should be spayed and neutered. You don't want to continue the cycle of homeless dogs or cats. And spaying and neutering also keeps them healthy."[155] PETA named her their "Person of the Year" in 2016. </p>

She applied for it prior to filming Jism 2. </p>

                                   <p> Leone is left handed. </p>

Leone has modelled fitness clothing for the sports brand Fantasy Fitness[165] and shared that she stays shape by working out as much as she can despite her busy schedule, commenting in Men's Fitness magazine, "I try to eat very healthy – lots of vegetables, drinking milk every day." </p>
							     
                                             <p> A 2008 Eye Weekly article reported that "Leone does her best to maintain a link to Sikh traditions, even if more in theory than in practice. But she's unlikely to disavow her career path due to religion" and that Leone said "Girls will leave the industry claiming that they found God. Well, the fact is, God has always been with them the entire time."[167] In a 2010 interview, she said </p>

                                   <p> It's a community-based religion. You walk into a temple and you're greeted with the utmost respect... But, just like any religion it doesn't want you to shoot adult material. I mean, I grew up going to temple every Sunday. When my parents found out they knew my personality which was very independent. Even if they tried to stop me or tried to steer me the right way they would have lost their daughter. I'm too headstrong. And it wasn't a plan. It just happened and my career and everything just kept getting bigger and bigger. </p>

							          <p> A police first information report was filed against Leone in May 2015 after a woman at Mumbai, India, complained that Leone's website, sunnyleone.com, was destroying the Indian culture. Thane police's cyber cell at Ramnagar booked her for sections 292, 292A, 294, which could have landed her a term in jail, a fine, or both. Senior police inspector JK Sawant stated, "We cannot block the website, but will ask the operator to remove objectionable content." </p>

                                             <p> In the 2017 new year, a pro-Kannada group Rakshana Vedike Yuva Sene protested against the event Sunny Night in Bengaluru NYE 2018 in Bangalore, Karnataka, at which Leone was to perform, stating that she should have been banned from the event due to her pornographic past. The protesters threatened a mass suicide, and Karnataka home minister Ramalinga Reddy denied her permission to appear at the event. </p>

                                   <p> Producer and distributor Bharat Patel has accused Leone of not returning a signing fee which she had taken to do a special dance number for his film Patel Ki Punjabi Shaadi after her role was cancelled. </p>
