						<p> Karenjit Kaur Vohra was born on May 13, 1981, in <a href="#">Sarnia, Ontario</a>, to <a href="#">Sikh</a> Indian <a href="#">Punjabi</a> parents. As a young girl, she was a self-described tomboy, very athletic and played street hockey with the boys. </p>
						
						<p> Although the family was <a href="#">Sikh</a>, her parents enrolled her in <a href="#">Catholic</a> school as it was felt to be unsafe for her to go to public school. When she was 13, her family moved to <a href="#">Fort Gratiot, Michigan</a>, then to <a href="#">Lake Forest, California</a>, a year later, fulfilling her grandparents' dream that the family be together in one place. She had her first kiss at 11, lost her virginity at 16 with a basketball player, and discovered her <a href="#">bisexuality</a> at 18. </p>
